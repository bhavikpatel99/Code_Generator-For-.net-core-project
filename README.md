This batch script is a .NET Core project generator designed to quickly scaffold a new MVC web project along with supporting class libraries and their necessary dependencies. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

### **Script Description:**
The script automates the creation of a .NET Core MVC web project with associated class libraries (Abstractions, Repository, Service, Common). It installs necessary NuGet packages, sets up project references, restores, builds the solution, and opens the project in Visual Studio Code.

### **Key Features:**
1. **Project Initialization:**
   - Prompts the user for the project name.
   - Creates a new MVC project targeting .NET 8.0.
   - Installs essential Razor Runtime Compilation for dynamic view updates.

2. **Class Library Setup:**
   - Creates four supporting class libraries (`Abstractions`, `Repository`, `Service`, `Common`) that follow a modular architecture pattern.

3. **NuGet Package Installation:**
   - Installs packages for the `Common` library, including `iText7`, `Serilog` for logging, `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis` for code analysis, and `ReportViewerCore` for reporting.
   - The `Repository` library receives packages like `Dapper` (micro-ORM), `Npgsql` (PostgreSQL support), and `System.Data.SqlClient` for SQL Server.

4. **Project Referencing:**
   - Adds necessary project references between the libraries to ensure proper communication and structure (e.g., `Service` references `Repository`, and `Common` references `Abstractions`).

5. **Build and Restore:**
   - Restores the solution to resolve dependencies.
   - Builds the project to ensure all code compiles correctly.

6. **Opening in Visual Studio Code:**
   - Upon successful creation, the script opens the project in Visual Studio Code for immediate development.

### **Purpose:**
This script is useful for quickly setting up a multi-layered .NET project, reducing manual steps in configuring class libraries, references, and dependencies, thereby improving developer productivity.
